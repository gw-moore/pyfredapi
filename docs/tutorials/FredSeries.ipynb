    "Before looking at series data, it is helpful to understand the `pyfredapi`'s `get_series_info` method and `SeriesInfo` object. Each series published by FRED has associated metadata, such as the observations start and end dates, the frequency at which the series is published, and so on. You can query a series' information directly with `get_series_info`. `get_series_info` returns a `SeriesInfo` object that contains all the metadata for the given series.\n",
