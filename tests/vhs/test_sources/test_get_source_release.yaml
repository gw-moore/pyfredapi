        Financial Accounts of the United States","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/","notes":"The
        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal
        Reserve\u2019s Z.1 statistical release.\r\n(1)\tTeplin, Albert M. \u201cThe

        changed in ways that significantly degraded their signal content, and including

        wealth measures. The data set contains the level and share of each balance

        Financial Accounts of the United States","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/","notes":"The
        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal
        Reserve\u2019s Z.1 statistical release.\r\n(1)\tTeplin, Albert M. \u201cThe
