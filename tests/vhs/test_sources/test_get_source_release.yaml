        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)

        model estimates turned out to be more sensitive to the detrending procedure
        than we had expected, the measurement of some indicators in recent years has
        changed in ways that significantly degraded their signal content, and including
        average hourly earnings as an indicator did not provide a meaningful link

        a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward
        rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the
        model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of

        wealth measures. The data set contains the level and share of each balance
        sheet item on the Financial Accounts'' household wealth table (Table B.101.h),
        for each of four percentile groups of wealth: the top 1 percent, the next
        9 percent (i.e., 90th to 99th percentile), the next 40 percent (50th to 90th
        percentile), and the bottom half (below the 50th percentile). The quarterly
        frequency makes the data useful for studying the business cycle dynamics of
        wealth concentration--which are typically difficult to observe in lower-frequency
        data because peaks and troughs often fall between times of measurement. These

        Financial Accounts of the United States","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/","notes":"The
        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal
        Reserve\u2019s Z.1 statistical release.\r\n(1)\tTeplin, Albert M. \u201cThe

        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal

        than we had expected, the measurement of some indicators in recent years has
        changed in ways that significantly degraded their signal content, and including
        average hourly earnings as an indicator did not provide a meaningful link

        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal

        of August 3, 2017, updates of the labor market conditions index (LMCI) have
        been discontinued; the July 7, 2017 vintage is the final estimate from this
        model. We decided to stop updating the LMCI because we believe it no longer
        provides a good summary of changes in U.S. labor market conditions. Specifically,
        model estimates turned out to be more sensitive to the detrending procedure
        than we had expected, the measurement of some indicators in recent years has
        changed in ways that significantly degraded their signal content, and including
        average hourly earnings as an indicator did not provide a meaningful link
        between labor market conditions and wage growth.\r\n\r\nThe LMCI is derived
        from a dynamic factor model that extracts the primary common variation from
        19 labor market indicators."},{"id":354,"realtime_start":"2023-09-02","realtime_end":"2023-09-02","name":"An

        research reviews a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model
        estimated by Federal Reserve Board staff and reports results obtained from
        fitting this model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990. The model ascribes
        a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward
        rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the
        model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of
        the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums,
        but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well."},{"id":388,"realtime_start":"2023-09-02","realtime_end":"2023-09-02","name":"Banking

        Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs) provide a quarterly measure of the
        distribution of U.S. household wealth since 1989, based on a comprehensive
        integration of disaggregated household-level wealth data with official aggregate
        wealth measures. The data set contains the level and share of each balance
        sheet item on the Financial Accounts'' household wealth table (Table B.101.h),
        for each of four percentile groups of wealth: the top 1 percent, the next
        9 percent (i.e., 90th to 99th percentile), the next 40 percent (50th to 90th
        percentile), and the bottom half (below the 50th percentile). The quarterly
        frequency makes the data useful for studying the business cycle dynamics of
        wealth concentration--which are typically difficult to observe in lower-frequency
        data because peaks and troughs often fall between times of measurement. These
        data will be updated about 10 or 11 weeks after the end of each quarter, making
        them a timely measure of the distribution of wealth."},{"id":460,"realtime_start":"2023-09-02","realtime_end":"2023-09-02","name":"Seasonal

        Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) is
        a quarterly survey providing information about the availability and terms
        of credit in securities financing and over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets,
        which are important conduits for leverage in the financial system. The participating
        institutions account for most of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated
        securities to non-dealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives
        markets. The survey is directed to senior credit officers responsible for
        maintaining a consolidated perspective on the management of credit risks.
        For further information, please refer to the SCOOS release at the Board of
        Governor\u2019s website: www.federalreserve.gov\/data\/scoos.htm\r\nIMPORTANT:  Although
        the raw data series are constructed as counts for each offered response to
        a survey question, the data are intended to be viewed as grouped by question,
        rather than by individual responses.  We recommend that it be accessed through
