        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.

        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.

        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.

        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.

        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.

        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price
        index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes
        in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods.
        The most common inflation metric is the percent change from one year ago.
        It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular
        index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for
        wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term
        workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\r\n\r\nThe
        CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation
        fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices
        are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000
        retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price
        changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending
        of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change)
        from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted
        index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally
        adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence
        a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally
        adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather,
        school year, production cycles, and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe CPI can be used to
        recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the
        CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant
        decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation.
        However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not
        be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more
        accurate detection, the core CPI (CPILFESL (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CPILFESL))
        is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to
        all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally,
        the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is
        based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\r\n\r\nFor more
        information on the consumer price indexes, see:  \r\nBureau of Economic Analysis.
