        Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/retail\/","notes":"The
        U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Advance Monthly Retail Trade and Food Services
        Survey to provide an early estimate of monthly sales by kind of business for
        retail and food service firms located in the United States. Each month, questionnaires
        are mailed to a probability sample of approximately 4,700 employer firms selected
        from the larger Monthly Retail Trade Survey. Advance sales estimates are computed
        using a link relative estimator. For each detailed industry, we compute a
        ratio of current-to previous month weighted sales using data from units for
        which we have obtained usable responses for both the current and previous
        month. For each detailed industry, the advance total sales estimates for the
        current month is computed by multiplying this ratio by the preliminary sales
        estimate for the previous month (derived from the larger MRTS) at the appropriate
        industry level. Total estimates for broader industries are computed as the
        sum of the detailed industry estimates. The link relative estimate is used
        because imputation is not performed for most nonrespondents in MARTS. For
        a limited number of nonresponding companies that have influential effects
        on the estimates, sales may be estimated based on historical performance of
        that company. The monthly estimates are benchmarked to the annual survey estimates
        from the Annual Retail Trade Survey once available. The estimates are adjusted
        for seasonal variation and holiday and trading day differences. Additional
        information on MARTS and MRTS can be found on the Census Bureau website at:

        Financial Accounts of the United States","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/","notes":"The
        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal
        Reserve\u2019s Z.1 statistical release.\r\n(1)\tTeplin, Albert M. \u201cThe

        Indicators Series","press_release":false,"link":"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/std\/leading-indicators\/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm","notes":"These
        time series are an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions
        data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/cycles\/cyclesmain.html
        and Organisation of Economic Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators:
        Reference Turning Points and Component Series data provided by the OECD at
        http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/std\/leading-indicators\/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm.
        Our time series are composed of dummy variables that represent periods of
        expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters, while the
        OECD identifies months, of turning points without designating a date within
        the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary
        convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within the period.
        The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the
        NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee or the OECD. A value of 1 is a recessionary
        period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary period.\r\n\r\nThe recession
        shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of
        dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into
        recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession
        shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between
        a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
        collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
        and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period. \r\n\r\nThe
        first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession
        from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly
        and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the
        month of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data
        is a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.\r\n\r\nThe
        second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession
        from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not
        included in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the
        recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and
        ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation
        of monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.\r\n\r\nThe
        third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from
        the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession
        shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the
        first day of the month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding
        the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data."},{"id":245,"realtime_start":"2024-11-02","realtime_end":"2024-11-02","name":"Summary

        5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of
        the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014

        day, month, or year within that time period.\r\n\r\nMultiyear  estimates  require  some  considerations  that  single-year  estimates  do  not.  For  example,  multiyear  estimates
        released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared
        data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011

        is the Survey of Economic Conditions?\r\nContacts located in the Seventh Federal
        Reserve District are asked to rate various aspects of economic conditions
        along a seven-point scale ranging from \"large increase\" to \"large decrease.\"
        A series of diffusion indexes summarizing the distribution of responses is
        then calculated.\r\n\r\nHow are the indexes constructed?\r\nRespondents''
        answers on the seven-point scale are assigned a numeric value ranging from
        +3 to \u20133. Each diffusion index is calculated as the difference between
        the number of respondents with answers above their respective average responses
        and the number of respondents with answers below their respective average
        responses, divided by the total number of respondents. The index is then multiplied
        by 100 so that it ranges from +100 to \u2212100 and will be +100 if every
        respondent provides an above-average answer and \u2013100 if every respondent
        provides a below-average answer. Respondents with no prior history of responses
        are excluded from the calculation.\r\n\r\nWhat do the numbers mean?\r\nRespondents''
        respective average answers to a question can be interpreted as representing
        their historical trends, or long-run averages. Thus, zero index values indicate,
        on balance, average growth (or a neutral outlook) for activity, hiring, capital
        spending, and cost pressures. Positive index values indicate above-average
        growth (or an optimistic outlook) on balance, and negative values indicate

        excludes households where selected monthly owner costs or gross rent cannot

        registration fees, and license fees).\r\n\r\nGross rent provides information
        on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. Gross rent is the contract
        rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas,
        and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these
        are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent
        is intended to eliminate differentials that result from varying practices
        with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental

        Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/retail\/","notes":"The
        U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Advance Monthly Retail Trade and Food Services
        Survey to provide an early estimate of monthly sales by kind of business for
        retail and food service firms located in the United States. Each month, questionnaires
        are mailed to a probability sample of approximately 4,700 employer firms selected
        from the larger Monthly Retail Trade Survey. Advance sales estimates are computed
        using a link relative estimator. For each detailed industry, we compute a
        ratio of current-to previous month weighted sales using data from units for
        which we have obtained usable responses for both the current and previous
        month. For each detailed industry, the advance total sales estimates for the
        current month is computed by multiplying this ratio by the preliminary sales
        estimate for the previous month (derived from the larger MRTS) at the appropriate
        industry level. Total estimates for broader industries are computed as the
        sum of the detailed industry estimates. The link relative estimate is used
        because imputation is not performed for most nonrespondents in MARTS. For
        a limited number of nonresponding companies that have influential effects
        on the estimates, sales may be estimated based on historical performance of
        that company. The monthly estimates are benchmarked to the annual survey estimates
        from the Annual Retail Trade Survey once available. The estimates are adjusted
        for seasonal variation and holiday and trading day differences. Additional
        information on MARTS and MRTS can be found on the Census Bureau website at:

        Financial Accounts of the United States","press_release":true,"link":"http:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/z1\/","notes":"The
        Financial Accounts (formerly known as the Flow of Funds accounts)  are a set
        of financial accounts used to track the sources and uses of funds by sector.
        They are a component of a system of macroeconomic accounts including the National
        Income and Product accounts (NIPA) and balance of payments accounts, all of
        which serve as a comprehensive set of information on the economy\u2019s performance.(1)
        Some important inferences that can be drawn from the Financial accounts are
        the financial strength of a given sector, new economic trends, changes in
        the composition of wealth, and development of new financial instruments over
        time.(1)\r\nSectors are compiled into three categories: households, nonfinancial
        businesses, and banks. The sources of funds for a sector are its internal
        funds (savings from income after consumption) and external funds (loans from
        banks and other financial intermediaries). (1) Funds for a given sector are
        used for its investments in physical and financial assets. Dividing sources
        and uses of funds into two categories helps the staff of the Federal Reserve
        System pay particular attention to external sources of funds and financial
        uses of funds.(2) One example is whether households are borrowing more from
        banks\u2014or in other words, whether household debt is rising. Another example
        might be whether banks are using more of their funds to provide loans to consumers.
        Transactions within a sector are not shown in the accounts; however, transactions
        between sectors are.(2) Monitoring the external flows of funds provides insights
        into a sector\u2019s health and the performance of the economy as a whole.
        \r\nData for the Financial accounts are compiled from a large number of reports
        and publications, including regulatory reports such as those submitted by
        banks, tax filings, and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System.(2)
        The Financial accounts are published quarterly as a set of tables in the Federal
        Reserve\u2019s Z.1 statistical release.\r\n(1)\tTeplin, Albert M. \u201cThe

        Indicators Series","press_release":false,"link":"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/std\/leading-indicators\/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm","notes":"These
        time series are an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions
        data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/cycles\/cyclesmain.html
        and Organisation of Economic Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators:
        Reference Turning Points and Component Series data provided by the OECD at
        http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/std\/leading-indicators\/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm.
        Our time series are composed of dummy variables that represent periods of
        expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters, while the
        OECD identifies months, of turning points without designating a date within
        the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary
        convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within the period.
        The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the
        NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee or the OECD. A value of 1 is a recessionary
        period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary period.\r\n\r\nThe recession
        shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of
        dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into
        recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession
        shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between
        a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
        collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
        and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period. \r\n\r\nThe
        first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession
        from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly
        and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the
        month of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data
        is a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.\r\n\r\nThe
        second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession
        from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not
        included in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the
        recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and
        ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation
        of monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.\r\n\r\nThe
        third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from
        the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession
        shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the
        first day of the month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding
        the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data."},{"id":245,"realtime_start":"2024-11-02","realtime_end":"2024-11-02","name":"Summary

        5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of
        the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014

        day, month, or year within that time period.\r\n\r\nMultiyear  estimates  require  some  considerations  that  single-year  estimates  do  not.  For  example,  multiyear  estimates
        released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared
        data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011

        Reserve District are asked to rate various aspects of economic conditions

        A series of diffusion indexes summarizing the distribution of responses is

        answers on the seven-point scale are assigned a numeric value ranging from

        the number of respondents with answers above their respective average responses
        and the number of respondents with answers below their respective average
        responses, divided by the total number of respondents. The index is then multiplied
        by 100 so that it ranges from +100 to \u2212100 and will be +100 if every
        respondent provides an above-average answer and \u2013100 if every respondent
        provides a below-average answer. Respondents with no prior history of responses

        excludes households where selected monthly owner costs or gross rent cannot
        be calculated.\r\n\r\nSelected monthly owner costs are the sum of payments
        for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on

        home equity loans, and other junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard,

        home costs (installment loan payments, personal property taxes, site rent,
        registration fees, and license fees).\r\n\r\nGross rent provides information
        on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. Gross rent is the contract
        rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas,
        and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these
        are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent
        is intended to eliminate differentials that result from varying practices
        with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental
        payment. The estimated costs of water and sewer, and fuels are reported on

        estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. ACS 5-year estimate
        includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the
        end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data
        from 2010 to 2014. However, they  do  not  describe  any  specific day, month,
        or year within that time period.\r\n\r\nMultiyear  estimates  require  some  considerations  that  single-year  estimates  do  not.  For  example,  multiyear  estimates
        released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared
        data. The 2010\u20132014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011
