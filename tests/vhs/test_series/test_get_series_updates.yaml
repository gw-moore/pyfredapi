        of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National
        Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/cycles\/cyclesmain.html.
        Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion
        and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without
        designating a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy
        variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at
        a specific date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect
        any judgment on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period
        of the peak and ends on the last day of the period before the trough. For
        more options on recession shading, see the notes and links below.\n\nThe recession
        shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of
        dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into
        recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession
        shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between
        a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
        collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
        and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be
        found at:\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECDM\n\nThe second
        interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the
        period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included
        in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession
        begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on
        the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of
        monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.

        to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the
        trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the
        month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough.

        The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without designating
        a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
        adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a specific
        date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment
        on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee. Our time series
        is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins on the 15th day of the
        month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of the month of the trough. This
        time series is a disaggregation of the monthly series. For more options on
        recession shading, see the note and links below.\n\nThe recession shading
        data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of dates that
        are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading
        data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data
        is available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and
        trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively
        extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually and
        collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be
        found at:\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECDM\n\nThe second
        interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the
        period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included
        in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession
        begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on
        the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of
        monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.

        to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the
        trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the

        federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade
        federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight.
        When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account,
        it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank
        with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another
        bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
        institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two
        banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is
        called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate
        is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve
        through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)\n\nThe
        Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine
        the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences
        the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying
        and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the
        Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising
        the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other
        banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government
        bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity
        for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends
        on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too
        fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the
        Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target
        to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a
        lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore,
        the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best
        course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering
        to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions,
        the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and
        wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and
        foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest
        rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such
        as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher
        credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences
        longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of
        which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\n\nReferences\n(1)

        federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight.
        When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account,
        it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank
        with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another
        bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
        institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two
        banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is
        called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate
        is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve
        through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)\nThe
        Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine
        the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences
        the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying
        and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the
        Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising
        the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other
        banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government
        bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity
        for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends
        on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too
        fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the
        Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target
        to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a
        lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore,
        the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best
        course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering
        to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions,
        the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and
        wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and
        foreign exchange markets.\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest
        rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such
        as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher
        credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences
        longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of
        which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\nReferences\n(1)

        Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/cycles\/cyclesmain.html.
        Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion
        and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without
        designating a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy
        variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at
        a specific date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect
        any judgment on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period
        of the peak and ends on the last day of the period before the trough. For
        more options on recession shading, see the notes and links below.\n\nThe recession
        shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of
        dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into
        recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession
        shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between
        a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
        collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
        and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be
        found at:\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECDM\n\nThe second
        interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the
        period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included
        in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession
        begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on
        the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of

        (NBER). Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods
        of expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning
        points without designating a date within the period that turning points occurred.
        The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred
        at a specific date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect
        any judgment on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period
        following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of the trough. For
        more options on recession shading, see the notes and links below.\n\nThe recession
        shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of
        dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into
        recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession
        shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between
        a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
        collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually
        and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        One version of this time series is represented using the midpoint method (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECM)
        The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession
        from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not
        included in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the
        recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and
        ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation

        The trough method is used for this series.\n\nThe third interpretation, known

        the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the trough
        is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the month
        of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily

        rate data, please see  Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/categories\/33951).\n\nThe
        federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade
        federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight.
        When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account,
        it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank
        with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another
        bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
        institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two
        banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is
        called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate
        is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve
        through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)\n\nThe
        Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine
        the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences
        the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying
        and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the
        Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising
        the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other
        banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government
        bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity
        for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends
        on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too
        fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the
        Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target
        to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a
        lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore,
        the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best
        course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering
        to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions,
        the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and

        historical federal funds rate data, please see  Daily Federal Funds Rate from
        1928-1954 (https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/categories\/33951).\n\nThe federal
        funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal
        funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight.
        When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account,
        it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank
        with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another
        bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
        institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two
        banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is
        called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate
        is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve
        through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)\nThe
        Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine
        the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences
        the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying
        and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the
        Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising
        the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other
        banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government
        bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity
        for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends
        on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too
        fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the
        Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target
        to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a
        lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore,
        the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best
        course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering
        to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions,
        the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and
        wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and
        foreign exchange markets.\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest
        rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such
        as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher
        credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences

        credit discount window program (https:\/\/www.frbdiscountwindow.org\/), which
        became effective January 9, 2003. \r\n\r\nPrimary credit is available to generally
        sound depository institutions at a rate set relative to the Federal Open Market
        Committee''s (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate. Depository institutions
        are not required to seek alternative sources of funds before requesting advances
        of primary credit. Primary credit may be used for any purpose, including financing
        the sale of federal funds. By making funds readily available at the primary
        credit rate the primary credit program complements open market operations
        in the implementation of monetary policy.\r\nReserve Banks ordinarily do not
        require depository institutions to provide reasons for requesting very short-term
        primary credit. Rather, borrowers are asked to provide only the minimum information
        necessary to process a loan, usually the amount and term of the loan.\r\n\r\nThis
        rate replaces that for adjustment credit, which was discontinued after January
        8, 2003. For further information, see Board of Governor''s  announcement (https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/boarddocs\/press\/bcreg\/2002\/200210312\/).

        of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National
        Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/cycles\/cyclesmain.html.
        The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without designating
        a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
        adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a specific
        date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment
        on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee. Our time series
        is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins on the 15th day of the
        month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of the month of the trough. This
        time series is a disaggregation of the monthly series. For more options on
        recession shading, see the note and links below.\n\nThe recession shading
        data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of dates that
        are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading
        data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data
        is available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and
        trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively
        extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually and
        collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be
        found at:\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECDM\n\nThe second
        interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the
        period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included
        in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession
        begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on
        the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of
        monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.

        to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the
        trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the

        date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment
        on this issue by the NBER''s Business Cycle Dating Committee. Our time series
        is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession.
        A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary
        period. For this time series, the recession begins on the 15th day of the
        month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of the month of the trough. This
        time series is a disaggregation of the monthly series. For more options on
        recession shading, see the note and links below.\n\nThe recession shading
        data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of dates that
        are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading
        data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data
        is available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and
        trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively
        extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually and
        collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part.
        In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the
        whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period.\n\nThe first
        interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from
        the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and
        quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month
        of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is
        a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire
        peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method
        shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly
        data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications.
        A version of this time series represented using the midpoint method can be
        found at:\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/USRECDM\n\nThe second
        interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the
        period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included
        in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession
        begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on
        the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of
        monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs.
        The midpoint method is used for this series.\n\nThe third interpretation,
        known as the peak method, is to show a recession from the period of the peak
        to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the
        trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the
        month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough.
